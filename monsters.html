  <h1>The <mark style="color: darkred;"><b>REAL</b></mark> Reason</h1>

  <p>Everybody from presidents to even your own parents all believe that socks disappear for <i>logical</i> reasons. How
    wrong they could be. The truth of sock loss is none other than what kids think hide under their beds, or in the
    dark,</p>

  <h2 style="text-shadow: 3px 3px 3px black; font-size: 50px; color:#3c5c45;">Monsters.</h2>

  <p>Yes, you read it right. Monsters are the reason your socks are disappearing every few days. But what are monsters
    exactly?</p>
  <dl>Monsters usually resemble bizarre, deformed, otherworldly and/or mutated animals or entirely unique creatures of
    varying sizes, but may also take a human form, such as mutants, ghosts and spirits, zombies or cannibals, among
    other things.</dl>
  <!-- wikipedia definition -->

  <p>See the image below? There is a monster manifesting as some sort of chicken duck, stealing a sock from my laundry.

    <p>I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to address a matter of importance, specifically regarding the belief
      in monsters based on incorrect information. It is crucial to understand that relying on misinformation to support
      such a belief can lead one to appear unintelligent. Firstly, monsters have been debunked by scientific inquiry,
      making it irrational to cling to notions unsupported by empirical evidence.</p>

    <p>Secondly, embracing unfounded beliefs without critical thinking demonstrates a lack of intellectual discernment.
      Intelligent individuals engage in critical analysis and rely on credible sources to shape their worldviews.
      Thirdly, clinging to the idea of monsters can hinder personal growth, as it distracts from more substantial
      intellectual pursuits.</p>

    <p>Moreover, perpetuating false information about monsters can contribute to the spread of baseless fears and
      misconceptions in society, further undermining one's credibility. In conclusion, it is imperative to reevaluate
      your stance on monsters and embrace a more informed, rational perspective to avoid being perceived as
      unintelligent.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Dale Bolido<br>(Content of letter written with ChatGPT)</p>

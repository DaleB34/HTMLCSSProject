  <h1>The "Science" of Sock Loss</h1>

  <p>Many more, inferior, researchers before me have come up with a more "scientific," "measurable," and "logical"
    reason that the number of socks you put in your laundry are lower than when you take it out.</p>

  <p>From the scientists at <a
      href="https://news.samsung.com/global/sock-horror-mystery-of-missing-socks-is-solved-scientists-reveal-why-socks-go-missing-in-the-wash-and-how-likely-it-is-to-happen#:~:text=Research%20interviews%20found%20the%20common,blow%20away%20%E2%80%93%20or%20they%20are">Samsung</a>
    , a formula has been found, linking the phenomonon of losing socks to a simple math equation, <i>The Sock Loss
      Index</i> represented by the equation <b>(L+C)-(P x A)</b>.</p>

  <table>

    <tr>
      <th>Variable</th>
      <th>Variable Meaning</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Laundry Size (L)</td>
      <td>Number of people in household * frequency of washes in a week</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Washing Complexity (C)</td>
      <td>Types of washes (darks + whites) * number of socks washed in a week</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Positivity towards doing laundry</td>
      <td>Measured on scale from 1 to 5, 1 being very negative, 5 being very positive</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Degree of Attention (A)</td>
      <td>Sum of number of activities being done at the same time</td>
    </tr>

  </table>

    <ul>
      <li>Lost during laundry transportation</li>
      <li>"Eaten" by washing/drying machine components</li>
      <li>Your laundry machine(s) exploded</li>

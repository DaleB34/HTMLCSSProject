  <h1>This Socks</h1>

  <p>Have you ever done a load laundry and discovered that you lost the other half of your favorite pair of SpongeBob
    socks?</p>

  <!-- put hover text to explain my jokes -->
  <!-- it would be super funny -->

  <p>If so, I, Dale Bolido, with my
    <a href="" title="30 minutes">extensive research</a>
    on the loss of that <a href="" title="Socks">piece of clothing you wear as a buffer between your foot and the
      shoe</a>, will inform you of the reasons why they may be disappearing, and how to prevent it from happening.
  </p>

  <!-- anchor "human error and coincidence" to go to different page -->
  <p>Some may think that the phenomenon of losing socks is due entirely to <a href="science.html">human error and
      coincidence</a>, while this may
    not be fully incorrect,
    <!-- anchor "monsters, yes monsters" to go to different page -->
    the more likely answer to the mystery is that <a href="monsters.html">monsters, yes monsters</a>,
    are making your beloved complements to footwear disappear.
